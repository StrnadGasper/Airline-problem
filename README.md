# Airline-problem

In this repository is a project done for college during my Masters study at FMF in Ljubljana.
It is a solution for the airline problem, which tackles the issue of an airline company, which has different types of aircraft in its fleet and operates different routes.
I optimized the parameters for which type of airpline to use on which route using linear programming.
